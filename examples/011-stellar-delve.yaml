summary: |
  Stellar Delve is gblfxt's major game project — a Dwarf Fortress-inspired 
  space colony sim in Unreal Engine 5.7. Core vision: workers are autonomous 
  agents using utility-based AI, with optional LLM director and player. 
  Features 100x100 tiles with Z-levels, 4-player co-op, 6 planet types 
  (Barren→Void progression), and deep systems (crafting, power, research, 
  survival). Most core systems complete. Uses C++ with Blueprints, Iris 
  networking, instanced meshes for voxel terrain. Multiple alien races 
  (Morphlings, Crystallites, Void Wisps, etc.). Active development with 
  Makefile workflow and headless testing.
