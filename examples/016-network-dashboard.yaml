summary: |
  Network Dashboard is a Flask-based web app running on gertrude (Kali Linux) 
  that monitors the home network. Uses ping sweep to discover devices on 
  192.168.70.0/24, maintains known device mappings with names/types/icons 
  for 40+ devices. Tracks device history, generates alerts, scans WiFi 
  networks via nmcli. Devices include smart home (Ring, Govee, Sonos, 
  Roborock), gaming (PS5, Switch, Steam Deck, Shield), computers, TVs, 
  and mobile devices. SQLite for persistence. Accessible at port 8081.
