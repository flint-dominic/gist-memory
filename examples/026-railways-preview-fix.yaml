    root_cause: Flywheel PartialModel doesn't inherit textures through parent chain
      with OBJ loader
    fix: Add textures directly at the same model level as the OBJ loader definition

summary: 'A phantom narrow/wide track preview black box issue was fixed by identifying
  the root cause as a Flywheel PartialModel texture inheritance problem. The solution
  involved adding textures directly at the same model level as the OBJ loader definition,
  with priority given to src/main/resources over src/resources in Gradle.
