summary: |
  Asset Lab is gblfxt's AI-powered 3D asset generation pipeline for game 
  development. Two paths: Local (ComfyUI + Blender) for control, or Cloud 
  (Meshy API) for rapid prototyping. Generates text/image → 3D mesh → 
  textures → rigging → LODs → UE5-ready assets. Supports multiple models 
  (TripoSR, Hunyuan3D, InstantMesh), reference image poses for different 
  asset types, auto-rigging via Mixamo/Playwright, and batch processing 
  from YAML presets. Python CLI tool with comprehensive commands. Built 
  to support Stellar Delve and other game projects.
