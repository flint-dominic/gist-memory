summary: |
  OptiG is gblfxt's domain-specific programming language for AI/ML, 
  implemented in Rust. Design philosophy: LLM-native with minimal tokens 
  and maximum clarity. Key features: native tensor literals ([1,2,3] is 
  a tensor), automatic differentiation, no imports ever (namespaced 
  builtins: io, nn, math, grad, etc.), indent-based syntax, control flow 
  as expressions (if/match return values, for loops return arrays), 
  errors as values (Result type). Components include lexer, parser, 
  interpreter, autograd, optional LLVM codegen, LSP server, and REPL.
