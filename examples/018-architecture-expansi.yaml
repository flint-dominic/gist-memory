summary: |
  Major architecture expansion session. Added three key components to gist-memory:
  (1) Hierarchical consolidation - four levels from raw gists to identity core,
  with sleep-like processing for compression over time.
  (2) Memory reinforcement - dynamic salience that changes based on use, with
  explicit forgetting curves for unreinforced memories.
  (3) Formal frame taxonomy - 19 named patterns organized into work/domain/
  relational/meta categories, each with indicators and relationships.
  Also researched parallel projects (Mem0, A-Mem) and confirmed our approach
  emphasizes portability over enterprise scale. The system remembering itself
  being designed.
