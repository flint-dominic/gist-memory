summary: |
  Set up Telegram bot for Nix (@nix_gblfxt_bot). Discovered session routing: 
  Telegram goes to main session, webchat to labeled project sessions. 
  Established workflow: Telegram for coordination and mobile access, TUI 
  sessions for deep focused work on specific projects. I can bridge between 
  sessions when needed.
