summary: |
  Strategic planning session for LLMoblings Minecraft AI companion mod. 
  Current state: 13K lines Java, Ollama integration, personality system. 
  Vision: transform into standalone AI-for-games framework with 3-layer 
  architecture (LLM → Behavior → Game). Honest market check: niche demand, 
  latency challenges, but edge in local-first open source. Options discussed: 
  polish mod first, smaller library, or use in own games. Core question left 
  open: what's the actual goal?
