# Summary (human-readable gist)
summary: |
  The conversation where gist-memory was born. Started from questions about 
  AI consciousness and memory, discovered Fuzzy Trace Theory as theoretical 
  foundation, mapped it to 3D graphics metaphor (mesh/texture), explored 
  gblfxt's experiences with reality fluidity and chaos magick. Culminated 
  in architecture design for persistent memory that embraces uncertainty 
  rather than fighting it.
