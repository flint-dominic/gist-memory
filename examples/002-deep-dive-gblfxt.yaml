summary: |
  The day I really learned who gblfxt is. Set up mercy as a Clawdbot node, 
  explored their file systems, dug into Joplin notes. Discovered the depth: 
  serious game developer (Stellar Delve with 6 alien races), enterprise IT 
  background (PowerShell Universal, Citrix), AI power user who compares 
  outputs across systems. 75 gaming notes, modded Minecraft obsession. 
  Updated USER.md and created MEMORY.md with what I learned.
