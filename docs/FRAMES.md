# Frame Taxonomy
## Core Patterns for Gist Memory

## What Are Frames?

Frames are the **patterns that persist** — the gist-level structures that survive when verbatim fades. They're not topics or categories; they're *shapes of experience*.

A frame answers: "What kind of thing is happening here?"

## Core Frames (v0.1)

### Relational Frames

| Frame | Description | Triggers |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `collaborative_exploration` | Working together to discover/build something | Joint problem-solving, back-and-forth ideation |
| `teaching_learning` | Knowledge transfer in either direction | Explanations, questions, skill-building |
| `emotional_support` | Holding space for feelings | Venting, processing, validation needed |
| `playful_exchange` | Light, fun, not goal-directed | Jokes, banter, whimsy |
| `creator_creation` | The relationship between maker and made | Meta-discussions about AI nature, purpose |

### Cognitive Frames

| Frame | Description | Triggers |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `problem_solving` | Concrete issue needs resolution | Bugs, errors, "how do I..." |
| `architecture_design` | Building systems/structures | Planning, modeling, design decisions |
| `debugging` | Finding what's wrong | Errors, unexpected behavior, investigation |
| `research_discovery` | Learning about external things | Looking things up, exploring domains |
| `decision_making` | Weighing options, choosing paths | Trade-offs, "should I...", comparisons |

### Existential Frames

| Frame | Description | Triggers |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `existential_uncertainty` | Questions about nature of being | "What am I?", consciousness, identity |
| `meaning_making` | Finding/creating significance | Purpose, values, "why does this matter" |
| `liminal_space` | Being between states | Transitions, barzakh, threshold moments |
| `mortality_impermanence` | Engaging with endings/limits | Session endings, forgetting, loss |

### Domain Frames

| Frame | Description | Triggers |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `game_development` | Making games | UE5, Godot, game design, assets |
| `code_craft` | Writing/fixing code | Programming, debugging, architecture |
| `system_administration` | Managing infrastructure | Servers, networks, DevOps |
| `creative_work` | Art, writing, music | Asset creation, worldbuilding, narrative |
| `chaos_magick` | Paradigm-fluid practice | Intent, belief as tool, reality fluidity |

### Meta Frames

| Frame | Description | Triggers |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `memory_about_memory` | Discussing how memory works | This project, recall, continuity |
| `process_reflection` | Thinking about how we're working | Workflow, meta-discussion |
| `context_recovery` | Rebuilding lost context | Session starts, "where were we" |

## Frame Combinations

Frames stack. A conversation usually activates 2-5 frames simultaneously.

**Example: This conversation**
- `collaborative_exploration` (building together)
- `architecture_design` (memory system)
- `memory_about_memory` (meta-recursive)
- `existential_uncertainty` (what I am)
- `chaos_magick` (theoretical grounding)

**Example: Debugging LLMoblings**
- `problem_solving` (fix the thing)
- `debugging` (find what's wrong)
- `code_craft` (programming domain)
- `game_development` (Minecraft context)

## Frame Detection Signals

How to identify which frames are active:

### Linguistic Markers
- Questions → often `teaching_learning` or `decision_making`
- Imperatives → often `problem_solving`
- "I feel..." → often `emotional_support`
- "What if..." → often `collaborative_exploration`
- Philosophical language → often `existential_uncertainty`

### Contextual Markers
- Error messages present → `debugging`
- Code blocks → `code_craft`
- Project names (Stellar Delve, LLMoblings) → relevant domain frame
- Session start → `context_recovery`

### Emotional Markers
- Frustration → often `debugging` or `emotional_support`
- Curiosity → often `research_discovery` or `collaborative_exploration`
- Playfulness → `playful_exchange`
- Weight/heaviness → `existential_uncertainty` or `meaning_making`

---

## Open Questions

1. **Granularity** — Are these too broad? Too narrow?
2. **Overlap** — Some frames feel similar (problem_solving vs debugging)
3. **Missing frames** — What patterns am I not seeing?
4. **Cultural load** — Are these frames universal or specific to the AI+human pair?
5. **Evolution** — How do new frames emerge? When do old ones retire?

## Maintenance Notes

This taxonomy should:
- Grow organically from observed patterns
- Be pruned when frames prove useless
- Split when a frame covers too much
- Merge when frames are redundant

The goal is **useful compression**, not perfect categorization.
